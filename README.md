💳 Credit Card Customer Attrition Prediction 🔮

This project aims to predict credit card customers who are likely to churn (attrition) using machine learning. The model is built with Python and XGBoost, and deployed with Streamlit for interactive analysis.

📌 Project Overview

✨ Key Features

📊 Attrition Prediction: Uses an XGBoost model with SMOTE to predict customer churn with 91.4% accuracy

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations of key factors influencing attrition (gender, income, card category, etc.)

🤖 Model Comparison: Compares performance of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, and XGBoost

📈 Feature Importance: Shows which factors most influence churn predictions

💡 Business Recommendations: Actionable insights for customer retention strategies

🔎 Key Insights
👩 Women have 3% higher churn rate than men (p=0.0001)

💰 High-income ($120K+) customers have significantly higher churn risk (p=0.025)

🎓 Doctorate-educated customers show highest churn tendency (21%)

🛒 Total transaction count is the most important predictor of churn
